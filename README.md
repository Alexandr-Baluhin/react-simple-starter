# About
This starter was created in purpose to make simple and fast deploy with React application. Starter was made on Create React App base. 

Starter include:
* Webpack bundler with already defined development and production configurations
* Less pre-proccessor loader
* ESLint
* Babel
* Polyfills (even for IE8)
* etc

Future plans:
* ~~React Hot Reload support (webpack hot modules for fast reloads)~~
* ~~React application pre-defined structure (core, features, modules, etc)~~
* React templates (?)
* ~~React Router~~

# Usage
First of all, run

`npm install`

Then there is currently two commands

`npm start` - for development

`npm run build` - for production

Production builds are placed in *build* directory.
